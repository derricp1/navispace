navispace - a repository for the TCNJ BookNav
=============================================

What is this?

At the core, it is a WiFi based Android app to navigate visitors to specific shelves in the TCNJ library.
The system uses a training process and fingerprinting to create an estimated set of signal strengths that the user will pick up at many given points at the library and uses them to estimate the user's current location.
Given this information and a call number, representing the book the user wants to go to, a path can be formed, which is updated in real time as the user moves.

What is the status of the project?

Currently, accelerometer-based turn detection is being tested. As well as this, general stakeholder testing is taking place to ensure that the rest of the components of the program are working properly and are easy to understand.
